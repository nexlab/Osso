Osso Beaglebone (white/black) I/O cape board support files

Osso is a Beaglebone (white/black) expansion cape with 8 digital optoinsulated inputs
and 8 relays 275VAC@10A.

Osso is shipped with the ability to switch optoinsulated inputs or non-optoinsulated inputs, to better fit user needs.
Docs about how to change input types: https://github.com/nexlab/Osso/wiki/Osso-Inputs

The expansion cape has to be powered by a 12VDC connector (9 to 24VDC supported), and it
will power the Beagleboard from expansion pins ( no needs to give external power
from usb or power connector on the beaglebone! )

The size of the cape is a standard format for 9 units DIN mount boxes.
